# Hi! I'm Araz Gholami

Since 2004, I make software to create things and to help others. My inspiration comes from nature and peoples like Derek Sivers and Mark Manson.
I like to make things that are as simple as possible and I enjoy solving hard problems.  
I prefer the challenges of teamwork to work alone.
I'm a climber and in love with adventures.  
Simplicity & neatness is valuable for me and humanity call the shots in my life.
