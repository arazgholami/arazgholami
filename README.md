# Hi there! I'm Araz Gholami

Since 2004, I make software to create things and to help others. My inspiration comes from nature and peoples like Derek Sivers and Mark Manson.<br>
I like to make things that are as simple as possible, and I enjoy solving hard problems.  <br>
I prefer the challenges of teamwork to work alone.<br>
I'm a climber and in love with adventures.  <br>
Simplicity & neatness is valuable for me and humanity call the shots in my life.
