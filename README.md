# Hi there! I'm Araz Gholami

Hello! I’m a software engineer and I have been developing and designing different projects since 2006, I like to find the easiest and most efficient way to tackle the most difficult problems. The teamwork challenges are always my preference rather than working alone despite the fact that I always try the best practices to enhance and update my knowledge. I'm a go-getter and a down to earth person. Simplicity & neatness is valuable for me and humanity calls the shots in my life.
My inspiration comes from nature and people like Derek Sivers and Mark Manson.
By the way! I’ve also translated “Anything you want” one of Derek Sivers books.
